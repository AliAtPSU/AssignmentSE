Alcatel announced a new tablet for T-Mobile this week called the POP 7 LTE. The POP 7 is a 7-inch tablet with a 1024 x 600 pixel display, 1.1GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB storage with microSD card slot, and a 3,240mAh battery. It is launching with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, making it one of the few tablets available with the latest version of Google's operating system. (Notable others being Google's own Nexus 7 (2013) and Nexus 9 and Nvidia's Shield tablet.)

The POP 7 is inexpensive too — at just $129.99, it's less than most Wi-Fi-only tablets and makes an ideal tablet for occasional use or a child. You can buy it from T-Mobile stores right now.
